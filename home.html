                    <p>For 25+ years, Dr. Klos ran a program called the Anxiety and Behavioral Program for Children, with offices in Bala Cynwyd,
                    Devon, and Paoli. The program focused on young children with developmental disabilities, physical disabilities, 
                    and significant chronic health problems. Dr. Klos focused on the treatment of anxiety and behavior problems in children, helping them learn 
                    better ways to manage their struggles. She has worked with children as young as 2 years old to help parents find ways to solve
                    problems their children are facing.</p>
