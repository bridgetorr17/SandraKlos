                <h4>Anxiety and Behavioral Program for Children</h4>
                <div class="sub2-container2">
                    <p>For 25+ years, I ran a program called the Anxiety and Behavioral Program for Children, with offices in Bala Cynwyd,
                    Devon, and Paoli. The program focused on young children with developmental disabilities, physical disabilities, 
                    and significant chronic health problems. I focused on the treatment of anxiety and behavior problems in children, helping them learn 
                    better ways to manage their struggles. I have worked with children as young as 2 years old to help parents find ways to solve
                    problems their children are facing.</p>

                <h4>Current Work</h4>
                <div class="sub2-container2">
                    <p>In <b>YEAR</b>, I decided to go back into clinical psychology. I missed working with clients and decided to set up a practice in Paoli. 
                    I also have a small home office in South Philadelphia suitable only for individual adult clients. I am continuing my work with children and adults, helping them overcome and cope with trauma and anxiety based behaviors. </p>

                <h4>Early Work</h4>
                <div class="sub2-container2">

                        Mental Health Center in Norristown. I worked with developmentally
                        delayed preschoolers, doing developmental evaluations and consulting with
                        parents and teachers for five years in Northeast Philadelphia. I was also the
                        Director of Psychology at Children's Rehabilitation Hospital in Philadelphia for
                        four years.</p>

                <div class="sub2-container2">
                    <p>I took an early retirement for 15 years to do international volunteering in East Africa and teaching in China. I was also a seasonal National Park Ranger for 
                    10 summer seasons in Haleakala National Park in Hawaii and Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming.</p>
