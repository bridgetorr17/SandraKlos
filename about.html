            <p>Dr. Klos is a behavioral psychologist, first and foremost. Her focus of treatment zeroes in on what you identify as
            something you want to change. Dr. Klos provides the knowledge and guidance to start where you are and find strategies that will
            move you in the direction you want to go.</p>
            <section class="sub1-container2">
                <h4>Is this Cognitive Behavioral Psychology?</h4>
                <p>Yes. At its core, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy helps people overcome struggles in their life by changing their thoughts. 
                Thoughts are internal mental behaviors that are susceptible to learning in the same way that outward behaviors are. This 
                approach can be extremely helpful by focusing on the issue at hand and working through practical methods to address that issue. 
                Strategies to cope can be both behavioral and cognitive. </p>

                <h4>What about a diagnosis?</h4>
                <p>Having a diagnosis is not the same thing as knowing how to handle the behavior. For children, it is especially important to make 
                sure that the coping mechanism makes the child feel good about him or herself. A diagnosis is not a solution to a behavior problem. 
                Mastery is always the answer, learning something new that both works and feels like a success.</p>

            <section class="sub1-container2">
                <h4>How are parents involved?</h4>
                <p>Dr. Klos works with a treatment model that involves both parents and children. Your child might have a behavior problem due to a learning difference, personality 
                characteristic, or in response to an upsetting experience. Dr. Klos asses the problem and its impact, developing treatment strategies, practice of new techniques,
                and ongoing assessment of progress and success of strategies. This leads to a happier outcome for all concerned. </p>

            <section class="sub1-container2">
                <h4>Does this work for Adults?</h4>
                <p>Yes. The principles of learning apply to adults who want to change either their behavior or the way that they are coping with the stresses
                of life. While Dr. Klos' work with adults is not as clearly goal centered as her work with children, the principles of learning underlie all of her
                interventions, and building new skills is the road, again, to mastery.</p>
